<h2>Description</h2>

Next to medical imaging occasionally lab members work on other types of data, with methods often at least partially inspired by (traditional) image processing and weakly-supervised learning techniques. Some projects include (not all are published yet):
 
<ul>
<li>Nikolaj Kjøller Bjerregaard developed a method for recognizing furigana in Japanese texts and comic books</li>
<li>Jannik Elsässer did a project on recognizing sea grass in underwater images</li>
<li> Patrick Wittendorff Abarzua Neira, Silas Roien Arildsen, Bertram Kosmo Hviid and Tobias Skovbæk Brund did a project on machine learning for sign language recognition </li>
<li>Dovile did a project on predictive maintenance of ball bearings in the pharmaceutical industry </li>
</ul>
