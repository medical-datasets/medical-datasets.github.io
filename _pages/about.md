# About

We are focusing on the data aspects of learning-based methods. Our aim is to build a community of scientists interested in understanding how the data we use affects the algorithms and society as a whole, instead of only optimizing for a performance metric. We draw inspiration from a variety of topics, such as data curation to build datasets, meta-data, shortcuts, fairness, ethics and philosophy in AI.

The best way to get a sense of our topics of interest is to look at our [webinar series](http://localhost:8080/publications/) and the [publications discussed during our workshop](http://localhost:8080/publications/).
