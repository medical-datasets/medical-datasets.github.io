# Datasets through the LðŸ‘€king-Glass
### â€” aka being a scientist in an upside down world 

Datasets through the LðŸ‘€king-Glass is a webinar series focusing on the data aspects on learning-based methods. Our aim is to build a community of scientists interested in understanding how the data we use affects the algorithms and society as a whole, instead of only optimizing for a performance metric. We draw inspiration from a variety of topics, such as data curation to build datasets, meta-data, shortcuts, fairness, ethics and philosophy in AI.

### Organizers
[Amelia JimÃ©nez-SÃ¡nchez](https://ameliajimenez.github.io) & [Veronika Cheplygina](https://veronikach.com) at IT University of Copenhagen (Denmark). This project has received funding from the Independent Research Fund Denmark - Inge Lehmann number 1134-00017B.

### Coming talks: TBA
* Feb / March 2023
