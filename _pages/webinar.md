# Datasets through the L👀king-Glass

Datasets through the L👀king-Glass is a webinar series focusing on the data aspects on learning-based methods. Our aim is to build a community of scientists interested in understanding how the data we use affects the algorithms and society as a whole, instead of only optimizing for a performance metric. We draw inspiration from a variety of topics, such as data curation to build datasets, meta-data, shortcuts, fairness, ethics and philosophy in AI.

All [previous talks](https://medical-datasets.github.io/webinar_talks) where the authors have agreed to share the talk, can be found in our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWCikipQZ8HILJaadZnNVyC9cLpg7A2dy).
