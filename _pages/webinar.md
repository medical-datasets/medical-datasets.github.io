# Datasets through the LðŸ‘€king-Glass

Datasets through the LðŸ‘€king-Glass is a webinar series focusing on the data aspects on learning-based methods. Our aim is to build a community of scientists interested in understanding how the data we use affects the algorithms and society as a whole, instead of only optimizing for a performance metric. We draw inspiration from a variety of topics, such as data curation to build datasets, meta-data, shortcuts, fairness, ethics and philosophy in AI.

#### Next talk:
Topic: **Datasets for medical image challenges**
