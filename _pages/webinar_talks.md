### Dr. Enzo Ferrante (CONICET, Argentina) 
Title: **Building and auditing a large-scale x-ray segmentation dataset with automatic annotations: Navigating fairness without ground-truth**

Abstract: The evolution of deep segmentation networks has empowered the enhancement of extensive x-ray datasets with automatically generated anatomical segmentation masks. When disseminating such enriched datasets, incorporating quality indices is crucial to quantify the reliability of each segmentation mask. Achieving this without the availability of expert medical annotations poses significant challenges. The complexity is further intensified by recent studies indicating potential biases in AI-based medical imaging models related to gender, age, and ethnicity. In this presentation, we will share insights from our journey in developing the CheXMask large-scale database. We will delve into the strategies we implemented for automatic quality control and the methods we formulated for unsupervised bias discovery in the absence of ground-truth annotations. We aim to foster a deeper understanding of the ethical considerations and responsibilities in deploying AI in medical imaging and to encourage the development of more robust and unbiased AI models in healthcare.

### Rhys Compton and Lily Zhang (New York University, USA) 
Title: **When more is less: Incorporating additional datasets can hurt performance by introducing spurious correlations**

Abstract: In machine learning, incorporating more data is often seen as a reliable strategy for improving model performance; this work challenges that notion by demonstrating that the addition of external datasets in many cases can hurt the resulting modelâ€™s performance. In a large-scale empirical study across combinations of four different open-source chest x-ray datasets, we demonstrate that in 43% of settings, a model trained on data from two hospitals hasÂ *poorer*Â worst group accuracy over both hospitals than a model trained on just a single hospitalâ€™s data. This surprising result occurs even though the added hospital makes the training distribution more similar to the test distribution. We explain that this phenomenon arises from the spurious correlation that emerges between the disease and hospital, due to hospital-specific image artifacts. We contextualize our results within the literature on spurious correlations to help explain these outcomes. Our experiments underscore the importance of exercising caution when selecting training data for machine learning models, especially in settings where there is a risk of spurious correlations such as with medical imaging.

Bio: 
* Rhys Compton holds a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from New York University, where he explored machine learning applications in healthcare, specifically looking at domain generalization / spurious correlations in chest X-ray data, which this talk focuses on.

### Dr. Jessica Schrouff (Google DeepMind, UK)
Title: **Detecting shortcut learning for fair medical AI**

Abstract: One potential driver of algorithmic unfairness, shortcut learning, arises when ML models base predictions on improper correlations in the training data. Diagnosing this phenomenon is difficult as sensitive attributes may be causally linked with disease. Using multitask learning, we propose a method to directly test for the presence of shortcut learning in clinical ML systems and demonstrate its application to clinical tasks in radiology and dermatology. Finally, our approach reveals instances when shortcutting is not responsible for unfairness, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to fairness mitigation in medical AI.

Bio: Jessica is a research scientist at Google DeepMind, working on responsible AI through a causal perspective. Previously, she was at Google Research where she investigated responsible machine learning for healthcare. Before joining Alphabet in 2019, she was a Marie Curie post-doctoral fellow at University College London (UK) and Stanford University (USA), developing machine learning techniques for neuroscience discovery and clinical predictions.

### Cathrine Damgaard & Trine Naja Eriksen (IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark)
Title: Annotation Label Reliability and Pathology Detection in Publicly Available Chest X-ray Datasets

Abstract: Deep learning models are becoming more prevalent for pathology detection in medical image analysis, as more large-scale medical image datasets are published. The models are, however, prone to make errors which a human specialist never would, even though they have been shown to obtain a better overall performance. This could be caused by the models learning unintended shortcuts, or that the datasets used for training the models often have labels obtained from medical reports associated with the images and not the actual images, making the labels less reliable for an image classification task. We explore pathology label reliability by comparing image review annotations from different sources on the same images, as well as tube label reliability by providing 1,011 non-expert annotations on chest X-ray images, indicating the presence of four different tube types.

Bio: Cathrine Damgaard & Trine Naja Eriksen have recently finished their masters at ITU, congrats to both of you! They have been doing great work during their research project and master thesis with us. Weâ€™re glad to have them at the webinar sharing their experience collecting chest drain annotations on X-ray images.

### Prof. Amber Simpson (Queenâ€™s University, Canada)

Title: **The medical segmentation decathlon**

Abstract: International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)â€”a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.

Bio: Amber Simpson is the Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Computing and Informatics, and Associate Professor jointly appointed in the Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences and School of Computing at Queenâ€™s University.

### David Wen (Oxford University Clinical Academic Graduate School, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)
Title: **Characteristics of open access skin cancer image datasets: implications for equitable digital health**.Â 

Abstract: Open-access datasets are increasingly used to develop machine learning algorithms for disease diagnosis, particularly skin cancer. However, prior to our systematic review, the content and characteristics of such datasets were not well understood. Our review aimed to evaluate open-access skin image datasets used to train algorithms for skin cancer diagnosis by exploring dataset characteristics and associated image metadata. This talk will outline the methodology and results of our systematic review, and discuss its implications for patient care and health equality.

MEDLINE, Google, and Google Dataset searches were performed to identify datasets, and their characteristics and metadata were extracted. Overall, 21 retrospective datasets containing 106,950 skin lesion images were identified. Among the 14 datasets reporting country of origin, eleven (79%) originated from Europe, North America and Oceania exclusively. Only two datasets (9%) reflected clinical practice, containing paired dermoscopic and macroscopic images. Clinical information was available regarding age for 81,662 images (76%), sex for 82,848 (77%), and body site for 79,561 (74%). Histopathological diagnoses were available for 69% of malignant lesions and 20% of all images. 1,415 images (1.3%) had ethnicity data. 2,236 images (2.1%) had Fitzpatrick skin-type data, of which only eleven (0.5%) were from darker-skinned individuals (type V-VI).

This systematic review revealed limited and variable reporting of key characteristics and metadata among datasets. Datasets had restricted population representation with substantial under-representation of darker skin types. This has implications for the performance of algorithms developed using these datasets in real-life clinical settings. Similar biases have also been identified in radiological and ophthalmological image datasets. Quality standards outlining minimum characteristics and metadata reporting for medical image datasets are urgently needed. Diverse image collection is required to build unbiased datasets, ensuring developed algorithms benefit individuals of all backgrounds and varying skin types.

Bio: Dr. David Wen is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dermatology academic clinical fellow at the University of Oxford and Oxford University Hospitals, United Kingdom. His research interests include use of artificial intelligence to improve skin cancer diagnosis and genotype-phenotype correlation in genetic skin disease.  David completed pre-clinical medical training at the University of Cambridge, clinical training at the University of Oxford, and subsequently undertook general medical training in London at Ealing and Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals. This was followed by a dermatology fellowship in epidermolysis bullosa at Solihull Hospital where he completed an MRes in Clinical Health Research at the University of Birmingham.

### Roxana Daneshjou (Stanford University, USA) 

Title: Challenges with equipoise and fairness in AI/ML datasets in dermatology

Abstract: Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to improve clinical care, but fair, generalizable algorithms depend on the clinical data on which they are trained and tested. To assess whether data sets used for training diagnostic AI algorithms addressing skin disease are adequately described and to identify potential sources of bias in these data sets. In this scoping review, PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1, 2015, and November 1, 2020, with the following paired search terms: deep learning and dermatology, artificial intelligence and dermatology, deep learning and dermatologist, and artificial intelligence and dermatologist. Studies that developed or tested an existing deep learning algorithm for triage, diagnosis, or monitoring using clinical or dermoscopic images of skin disease were selected, and the articles were independently reviewed by 2 investigators to verify that they met selection criteria. Data set audit criteria were determined by consensus of all authors after reviewing existing literature to highlight data set transparency and sources of bias. A total of 70 unique studies were included. Among these studies, 1 065 291 images were used to develop or test AI algorithms, of which only 257 372 (24.2%) were publicly available. Only 14 studies (20.0%) included descriptions of patient ethnicity or race in at least 1 data set used. Only 7 studies (10.0%) included any information about skin tone in at least 1 data set used. Thirty-six of the 56 studies developing new AI algorithms for cutaneous malignant neoplasms (64.3%) met the gold standard criteria for disease labeling. Public data sets were cited more often than private data sets, suggesting that public data sets contribute more to new development and benchmarks. This scoping review identified 3 issues in data sets that are used to develop and test clinical AI algorithms for skin disease that should be addressed before clinical translation: (1) sparsity of data set characterization and lack of transparency, (2) nonstandard and unverified disease labels, and (3) inability to fully assess patient diversity used for algorithm development and testing.

Bio: Roxana Daneshjou received her undergraduate degree at Rice University in Bioengineering. She subsequently completed her MD PhD at Stanford University. During this time, she was awarded several fellowships. She has completed Dermatology residency at Stanford in the research track, and now she practices dermatology as a clinical scholar in Stanfordâ€™s department of Dermatology, and also conducts artificial intelligence research in Biomedical Data Science. Her research interests are in developing diverse data sets and fair algorithms for applications in Dermatology and Artificial Intelligence.
