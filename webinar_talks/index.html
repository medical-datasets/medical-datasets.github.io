In the medical domain, such simplification is highly desired to enhance patient understanding, yet it remains underexplored in Japanese due to the scarcity of linguistic resources. In this study, we construct a parallel corpus for evaluating Japanese medical text simplification, using data collected from patient weblogs. The corpus consists of 1,425 pairs of complex and simplified sentences, with and without medical terminology. To further improve readability, we introduce a lexically constrained reranking method that suppresses the output of technical terms. Experimental results show that our approach enhances simplification performance in the medical domain, demonstrating its potential for patient-centered healthcare communication.</p> <p>Short bio: Yuki Arase is a professor at the School of Computing, Institute of Science Tokyo (aka Tokyo Institute of Technology), Japan.

Rumala (UNIVERSA AI, Switzerland)</h3> <p>Title: <strong>Seeing the Same Brain Twice: Data Leakage and Identity Bias in Brain MRI Analysis</strong></p> <p>Abstract: Deep learning models for medical imaging are often praised for their accuracy and the potential for healthcare application. However, many overlook subtle pitfalls that can undermine real-world applicability. One such issue is data leakage, which can lead to misleadingly optimistic performance. In this talk, we explore how subtle forms of data leakage, especially in longitudinal data, can lead models to exploit subject identity rather than learning meaningful clinical features. We discuss the challenges of cross-validation design in this context, and how even robust-looking 3D CNNs can pick up identity cues when repeated scans of the same subject leak into both training and validation sets. The use of GradCAM further exposes the shortcuts taken by the model. By revisiting our findings from the Alzheimer’s disease classification task, we reflect on how careful dataset splitting and evaluation strategies can improve robustness and fairness in neuroimaging AI.</p> <p>Bio: Dewinda holds a PhD in Computer Science from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia, awarded through the PMDSU Scholarship by the Ministry of Research and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.

However, these methods have been shown to be subject to race bias; i.e. they exhibit different levels of performance for different races depending on the (im)balance of the data used to train the AI model. We trained AI models to perform race classification on cine CMR images and/or segmentations from White and Black subjects and found that the classification accuracy for images was higher than for segmentations. Interpretability methods showed that the models were primarily looking at non-heart regions. A number of possible confounders for the bias in segmentation model performance were identified for Black subjects but none for White subjects. Distributional differences between annotated CMR data of White and Black races, which can lead to bias in trained AI segmentation models, are predominantly image-based. Most of the differences occur in areas outside the heart, such as subcutaneous fat.</p> <p>Bio: Tiarna Lee holds a Master’s degree in Biomedical/Medical Engineering from King’s College London.

This lack of attention may harm the generalizability of algorithms and, consequently, negatively impact patient outcomes. While existing medical imaging literature reviews mostly focus on machine learning (ML) methods, with only a few focusing on datasets for specific applications, these reviews remain static — they are published once and not updated thereafter. This fails to account for emerging evidence, such as biases, shortcuts, and additional annotations that other researchers may contribute after the dataset is published. We refer to these newly discovered findings of datasets as research artifacts. To address this gap, we propose a living review that continuously tracks public datasets and their associated research artifacts across multiple medical imaging applications. Our approach includes a framework for the living review to monitor data documentation artifacts, and an SQL database to visualize the citation relationships between research artifact and dataset. Lastly, we discuss key considerations for creating medical imaging datasets, review best practices for data annotation, discuss the significance of shortcuts and demographic diversity, and emphasize the importance of managing datasets throughout their entire lifecycle.

Human experiences are shaped by diverse streams of information—visual, textual, auditory, and structured data—all interacting in complex ways. Similarly, identities are layered and multifaceted, with factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic status intersecting to influence lived realities. In the context of healthcare, biases in automated clinical decision-making using Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) exacerbate disparities in patient care and outcomes, particularly for intersectional subgroups. The multimodal nature of EHR data—integrating text, time series, tabular information, events, and images—adds complexity to bias mitigation, as the impact on minority groups varies across modalities. In this talk, we first discuss the ways to learn unified representations from heterogeneous data using pre-trained models. Then, we will discuss the limitations of conventional bias mitigation strategies, highlighting their inability to address the nuanced biases affecting intersectional subgroups in multimodal setting. We will then explore the impact of bagging strategies on fairness improvement using extensive multimodal datasets, MIMIC-Eye and MIMIC-IV ED. We will conclude by examining the conditions and factors that drive the positive correlation bagging and fairness improvements, showcasing scenarios where these strategies succeed.

Prior work has demonstrated that checklists can be learned from binary input features in a data-driven manner by formulating the training objective as an integer programming problem. In this work, we learn diagnostic checklists for the task of phenotype classification with time series vitals data of ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. For 13 clinical phenotypes, we fully explore the empirical behavior of the checklist model in regard to multimodality, time series dynamics, and fairness. Our results show that the addition of the imaging data modality and the addition of shapelets that capture time series dynamics can significantly improve predictive performance. Checklist models optimized with explicit fairness constraints achieve the target fairness performance, at the expense of lower predictive performance.

As the number of DL architectures explodes, exhaustively attempting all candidates becomes unfeasible, motivating cheaper alternatives for choosing them. Transferability scoring methods emerge as an enticing solution, allowing to efficiently calculate a score that correlates with the architecture accuracy on any target dataset. However, since transferability scores have not been evaluated on medical datasets, their use in this context remains uncertain, preventing them from benefiting practitioners. We fill that gap in this work, thoroughly evaluating seven transferability scores in three medical applications, including out-of-distribution scenarios. Despite promising results in general-purpose datasets, our results show that no transferability score can reliably and consistently estimate target performance in medical contexts, inviting further work in that direction.</p> <p>Bio: Alceu Bissoto holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the Institute of Computing at University of Campinas (UNICAMP), and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Federal University of São Carlos (2016).

Many researchers have pointed to the importance of the annotation step in the creation of high-quality data, but less attention has been paid to the work that enables data annotation. We define this work as the design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design. Two internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling. These directly shape the design of the ground truth schema. Discussions of what constitutes high-quality data need to pay attention to the factors that shape and constrain what is possible to be created, to ensure responsible AI design.</p> <p>Bio: Hubert D.

In a large-scale empirical study across combinations of four different open-source chest x-ray datasets, we demonstrate that in 43% of settings, a model trained on data from two hospitals has <em>poorer</em> worst group accuracy over both hospitals than a model trained on just a single hospital’s data. This surprising result occurs even though the added hospital makes the training distribution more similar to the test distribution. We explain that this phenomenon arises from the spurious correlation that emerges between the disease and hospital, due to hospital-specific image artifacts. We contextualize our results within the literature on spurious correlations to help explain these outcomes. Our experiments underscore the importance of exercising caution when selecting training data for machine learning models, especially in settings where there is a risk of spurious correlations such as with medical imaging.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <ul> <li>Rhys Compton holds a Master’s in Computer Science from New York University, where he explored machine learning applications in healthcare, specifically looking at domain generalization / spurious correlations in chest X-ray data, which this talk focuses on.</li> <li>Lily Zhang is a PhD candidate at New York University in the Center for Data Science.

Diagnosing this phenomenon is difficult as sensitive attributes may be causally linked with disease. Using multitask learning, we propose a method to directly test for the presence of shortcut learning in clinical ML systems and demonstrate its application to clinical tasks in radiology and dermatology. Finally, our approach reveals instances when shortcutting is not responsible for unfairness, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to fairness mitigation in medical AI.</p> <p>Bio: Jessica is a research scientist at Google DeepMind, working on responsible AI through a causal perspective.

The models are, however, prone to make errors which a human specialist never would, even though they have been shown to obtain a better overall performance. This could be caused by the models learning unintended shortcuts, or that the datasets used for training the models often have labels obtained from medical reports associated with the images and not the actual images, making the labels less reliable for an image classification task. We explore pathology label reliability by comparing image review annotations from different sources on the same images, as well as tube label reliability by providing 1,011 non-expert annotations on chest X-ray images, indicating the presence of four different tube types.</p> <p>Bio: Cathrine Damgaard &amp; Trine Naja Eriksen have recently finished their masters at ITU, congrats to both of you!

Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)—a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.</p> <p>Bio: Amber Simpson is the Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Computing and Informatics, and Associate Professor jointly appointed in the Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences and School of Computing at Queen’s University.

However, prior to our systematic review, the content and characteristics of such datasets were not well understood. Our review aimed to evaluate open-access skin image datasets used to train algorithms for skin cancer diagnosis by exploring dataset characteristics and associated image metadata. This talk will outline the methodology and results of our systematic review, and discuss its implications for patient care and health equality.</p> <p>MEDLINE, Google, and Google Dataset searches were performed to identify datasets, and their characteristics and metadata were extracted. Overall, 21 retrospective datasets containing 106,950 skin lesion images were identified. Among the 14 datasets reporting country of origin, eleven (79%) originated from Europe, North America and Oceania exclusively. Only two datasets (9%) reflected clinical practice, containing paired dermoscopic and macroscopic images. Clinical information was available regarding age for 81,662 images (76%), sex for 82,848 (77%), and body site for 79,561 (74%). Histopathological diagnoses were available for 69% of malignant lesions and 20% of all images. 1,415 images (1.3%) had ethnicity data. 2,236 images (2.1%) had Fitzpatrick skin-type data, of which only eleven (0.5%) were from darker-skinned individuals (type V-VI).</p> <p>This systematic review revealed limited and variable reporting of key characteristics and metadata among datasets. Datasets had restricted population representation with substantial under-representation of darker skin types. This has implications for the performance of algorithms developed using these datasets in real-life clinical settings. Similar biases have also been identified in radiological and ophthalmological image datasets. Quality standards outlining minimum characteristics and metadata reporting for medical image datasets are urgently needed. Diverse image collection is required to build unbiased datasets, ensuring developed algorithms benefit individuals of all backgrounds and varying skin types.</p> <p>Bio: Dr. David Wen is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dermatology academic clinical fellow at the University of Oxford and Oxford University Hospitals, United Kingdom.

To assess whether data sets used for training diagnostic AI algorithms addressing skin disease are adequately described and to identify potential sources of bias in these data sets. In this scoping review, PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1, 2015, and November 1, 2020, with the following paired search terms: deep learning and dermatology, artificial intelligence and dermatology, deep learning and dermatologist, and artificial intelligence and dermatologist. Studies that developed or tested an existing deep learning algorithm for triage, diagnosis, or monitoring using clinical or dermoscopic images of skin disease were selected, and the articles were independently reviewed by 2 investigators to verify that they met selection criteria. Data set audit criteria were determined by consensus of all authors after reviewing existing literature to highlight data set transparency and sources of bias. A total of 70 unique studies were included. Among these studies, 1 065 291 images were used to develop or test AI algorithms, of which only 257 372 (24.2%) were publicly available. Only 14 studies (20.0%) included descriptions of patient ethnicity or race in at least 1 data set used. Only 7 studies (10.0%) included any information about skin tone in at least 1 data set used. Thirty-six of the 56 studies developing new AI algorithms for cutaneous malignant neoplasms (64.3%) met the gold standard criteria for disease labeling. Public data sets were cited more often than private data sets, suggesting that public data sets contribute more to new development and benchmarks. This scoping review identified 3 issues in data sets that are used to develop and test clinical AI algorithms for skin disease that should be addressed before clinical translation: (1) sparsity of data set characterization and lack of transparency, (2) nonstandard and unverified disease labels, and (3) inability to fully assess patient diversity used for algorithm development and testing.</p> <p>Bio: Roxana Daneshjou received her undergraduate degree at Rice University in Bioengineering.
