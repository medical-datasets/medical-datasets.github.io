After our in-person workshop, we have written a joint paper [In the Picture: Medical Imaging Datasets, Artifacts, and their Living Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10727). We propose a living review that continuously tracks public datasets and their associated research artifacts across multiple medical imaging applications.
